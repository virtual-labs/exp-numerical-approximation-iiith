For many mathematical problems, such as finding area under a curve, it may not be possible to find an exact formula. But still these can be computed to arbitrary precision by using appoximate methods. In this lab you will learn how to code these approximation methods to solve these problems using a computer.

#### Objective

1. To understand that for some problems an approximate numerial solution is as good as the exact solution for practical purposes.
2. To understand how to apply these solutions to obtain arbitrary precision.
